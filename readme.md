## Keyboard triggered Karplus-Strong Guitar with MIDI Controls

This is a mashup of a few awesome WebAudio projects to demonstrate the power of WebAudio.

This uses

- [Audiokeys](https://github.com/kylestetz/AudioKeys) - for the keyboard callbacks and keyboard -> midi note mapping
- [JavaScript/Web Audio Karplus-Strong ](https://github.com/mrahtz/javascript-karplus-strong) - for the actual synthesis
- [jQuery Knob](https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob) - for jQuery knobs
- [midimessage](https://github.com/notthetup/midimessage) - to enable triggering the keys through a MIDI device.

and some glue code to make stuff work.

Have fun!
